# creatingAPI
 Having some fun/learning while creating an API!

This project was all about the creation of an API; this API can be used for: authenticate users by the register/login method, and validate them to create a fanfic.
In this API, the database I choose to work with was PostgreSQL, alongside Prisma - to have a lot of flexibility, and an easier job while working with Postman. 

Also, all the project is following the MVC patterns alongside the RESTful pattern for APIs.

To create all this thing, I used the following technologies/libraries:

1) TypeScript;

2) PostgreSQL;

3) Prisma;

4) Postman;

5) Zod;

6) Jsonwebtoken

7) Dotenv, Cors and Jest.

If, for some reason you want to download this project in your machine and test it, you can download the repository file; and in the terminal, type the following things (by the way, you would also need an engine like Postman/Insomnia to send JSON messages to the API):

- npm i;

- npm run dev ./src/index.ts
